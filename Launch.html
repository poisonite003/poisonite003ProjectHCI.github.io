Mercury has only 4,862 km, on the surface Mercury gives off hot and dry energy. Mercury will move around the sun 1 time in 88 days and will rotate with a rotation period of 59 days because Mercury does not have satellites.

The second planet in the solar system, after Mercury. The hottest planet in the solar system with a temperature of 900째F (465째C). Its rotation direction is different from that of other planets (opposite) It is more than 67 million miles (108 million km) from the Sun. One day on Venus is equal to 243 days on Earth. This is due to the rotation of Venus which rotates backwards from the other planets. So, the sun rises on Venus not in the east, but from the west. While setting in the east.</p>
